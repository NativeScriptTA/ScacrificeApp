This game is meant as a stress reliever. The concept of the game is that a person can choose any other user and try to preform a spell on them. A spell could be either positive or negative. The type of spell affects the caster as well, so the darker the spell the more vunerable is that specific player. Each player will have a certain number of spells a day, would be affected by their level and other stats. Once a spell is successfully casted the affected player is notifed and the result of the spell is applied. 

Spells will not be known initially to the player, so there will be a element of exploration. A spell can be either successfull or not, and depending ont the spell there will be a number of actions that need to be completed. Action could be in the area of incantations, motion detection and drawing a pattern. 

Each spell will be divided in stages. First stage picking ingridients. Setting up the spell. Preforming th spell and seeing the effects.
